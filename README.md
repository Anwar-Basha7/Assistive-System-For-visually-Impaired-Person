## About the Project

This project integrates multiple technologies to assist visually impaired individuals. It utilizes object detection to identify objects, face recognition to recognize known individuals, and text-to-speech to communicate information to the user.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies and labels objects in real-time.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes and identifies known faces.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts detected information into spoken words.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Required packages: ultralytics, face_recognition, speech_recognizer, pyttsx3, tesseract

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anwar-Basha7/Assistive-System-For-visually-Impaired-Person.git
   cd Assistive-System-For-visually-Impaired-Person
   pip install face_recognition ultralytics speach_recognition imutils pyttsx3 pytessract 

### Usage
Before running the project, make sure you have all the required files, including the best.pt file and the pickle files generated during the training of the model for object recognition and face recognition.

Run the code using the following command:
  
  ### python main.py
