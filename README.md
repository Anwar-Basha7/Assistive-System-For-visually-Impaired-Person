This project integrates multiple technologies to assist visually impaired individuals. It uses object detection to identify objects, face recognition to recognize known individuals, and text-to-speech to communicate information to the user.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies and labels objects in real-time.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes and identifies known faces.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts detected information into spoken words.
